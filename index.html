                <p>My name is Matt Perroni. I am currently a teacher in Ft. Collins, CO. I have taught elementary
                    school
                    for the past 13 years.
                    I have taught 2nd, 3rd, and 4th grades. I have had the opportunity to travel and teach across
                    Colorado,
                    in Europe, and in Asia.
                    I met my wife teaching in Western Colorado and have a passion for learning and teaching. I run an
                    after
                    school LEGO Robotics club
                    where I help students build, code, and compete in challenges.
                </p>

                <p>I graduated with a Human Development & Family Studies degree rom Colorado State University. I
                    completed
                    my alternative teacher's license
                    from Western State a year later. After having taught for a few years I went back to school for a
                    Master
                    of Educational Technology degree from
                    Boise State University. I have had the opportunity to attend multiple professional development
                    trainings and conferences from Apple to
                    Google. I am a Certified Google Educator and have become a go to person in my school for technology
                    advice.
                </p>

                <p>For as long as I can remember I have been fascinated by technology. I remember being the one to have
                    to
                    call the technical service
                    department to fix our family computer when I was in 5th grade. About the same time I taught myself
                    HTML
                    from the Tu Cows website and built
                    multiple pages for my family and friends. My original major in college was Computer Science and my
                    passion for technology has never
                    gone away. I'm looking forward to learning more and applying it in a technology job in the near
                    future.
